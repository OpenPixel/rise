Inspiration
===========

* `hashicorp/hil <https://github.com/hashicorp/hil>`_ - Used to perform interpolation
* `hashicorp/hcl <https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl>`_ - Used as a configuration syntax for variables
* `hashicorp/terraform <https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform>`_ - Inspiration for the tool. A number of the interpolation functions have been extracted directly from terraform.
